# MovieCalendar

This is the repository for my individual project that I am calling "Movie Calendar"

### Problem Statement

I am a big movie lover and tend to go to movies or buy them pretty frequently. With so many releases happening on a weekly basis, it is hard for me to keep track of when stuff gets released.

MovieCalendar will send you a reminder when a movie is about to be released. You can decide if you want notifications on theatrical released, digital release, or physical release. It will also allow you to choose when you want to be notified of impending release (days, weeks, months).
