### Problem Statement

I am a big movie lover and tend to go to movies or buy them pretty frequently. With so many releases happening on a weekly basis, it is hard for me to keep track of when stuff gets released.

MovieCalendar will send you a reminder when a movie is about to be released. You can decide if you want notifications on theatrical released, digital release, or physical release. It will also allow you to choose when you want to be notified of impending release (days, weeks, months).

### Project Technologies/Techniques
* Bootstrap: Will be using the bootstrap web design for all sites
* Quartz Scheduler: This will let me schedule my app to run daily to find reminders that need to be sent
