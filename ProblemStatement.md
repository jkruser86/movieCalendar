# Problem Statement

There are lots of times in my life when I get the urge to watch a specific movie that I do not own. When I decide to watch a movie and before I go and rent or buy it, I want to check some of the streaming sites that I subscribe to. I currently have subscriptions to 4 various stream sites and have to manually search through all of them to see if the specific movie or TV show is available. Instead, I would like a single search engine which would allow me to search one place to see if the video is available from any of these streaming services. If the movie is not available, your search can be added to a daily scan which will email you to notify you when videos matching the search criteria are available.
